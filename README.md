<h5> A web application that allows you to check the national holidays and receive an inspirational quote each day. </h5>

<p> I like to share my calligraphy work of a motivational quote every Monday and national holidays every week with my friends. Therefore, I decided to build a web application for everyone to check the daily national holidays and inspirational quote with additional features such as the current date and time. 

My stretch goal is to create a Google Chrome extension similar to Momentum.</p>

A notable feature is an inspirational quote at the bottom of the page. Similarly to the national holidays, the inspirational quote changes each day. If you hover over the quote, the author's name will display.
